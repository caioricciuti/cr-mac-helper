=== Battery Maintenance and Optimization Tips ===

General Battery Care:
--------------------
1. Keep your MacBook updated to the latest macOS version for battery optimizations.
2. Avoid extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) which can degrade battery capacity.
3. For long-term storage (>6 months), store with battery at ~50% charge, not full or empty.
4. Perform an occasional full charge cycle (0-100%) once a month to help calibrate the battery.

Daily Usage Tips:
----------------
1. Reduce screen brightness - display is a major power consumer.
2. Use automatic brightness adjustment (System Preferences â Displays).
3. Enable dark mode when using your Mac at night (System Preferences â General).
4. Close unused applications, especially those using significant CPU or GPU.
5. Disable keyboard backlighting when not needed.
6. Use Safari instead of Chrome when on battery (Safari is more energy-efficient).
7. Disconnect unused external devices (hard drives, USB devices, etc).
8. Turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not in use.
9. Use "Battery" symbol in the menu bar to quickly check which apps are using significant energy.

Battery-Draining Features to Manage:
----------------------------------
1. Location Services - disable for apps that don't need it
2. Spotlight Indexing - consider scheduling major file operations when plugged in
3. Background App Refresh - limit to essential apps
4. Reduce notifications to limit screen wake-ups
5. Disable unused connectivity features (AirDrop, Handoff, etc.) when not needed
6. Mail should fetch new messages less frequently or manually

Energy Saver/Battery Preferences:
-------------------------------
1. Enable automatic graphics switching to use integrated GPU when possible
2. Enable "Put hard disks to sleep when possible"
3. Consider using Power Nap only when connected to power
4. Set shorter display sleep time when on battery
5. Use Low Power Mode when needed for maximum battery life

Battery Health:
-------------
1. Modern MacBooks have battery health management enabled by default (System Preferences â Battery â Battery â Battery Health)
2. Consider disabling battery health management only if you frequently use your Mac in high-temperature environments
3. A healthy battery should retain 80% or more of its original capacity after 1000 charge cycles
4. If your battery health drops below 80%, consider having it serviced

For MacBooks with Apple Silicon:
------------------------------
1. Apple Silicon Macs have excellent battery efficiency out of the box
2. Use Optimized Battery Charging to reduce battery aging
3. Rosetta 2 emulation for Intel apps uses more power - prefer native Apple Silicon apps when possible
4. System Settings â Battery â Low Power Mode can dramatically extend battery life
